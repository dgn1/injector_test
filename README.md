# injector_test

This was code developed on and for an arduino nano every to activate the fuel injectors based on inputs from the ECU for a 4AGE engine (in a toyota mr2)
The purpose was to test the injectors (which were thought to not work)
This ought to work for any vehicle with fuel injection....

Pots were used to control the duration and delay of the activation timing (hard start condition thought to result from poor timing - one way to compensate)

Released under a MIT license. (Enjoy!)
